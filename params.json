{"name":"GameQ","tagline":"A PHP library for querying game and voice servers","body":"### Requirements\r\n* PHP 5.4.14+ - [Tested](https://travis-ci.org/Austinb/GameQ) in PHP 5.4, 5.5, 5.6 & [HHVM](http://hhvm.com/)\r\n* [Bzip2](http://www.php.net/manual/en/book.bzip2.php) - Used for A2S Compressed responses\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\n#### [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)\r\nThis method assumes you already have composer [installed](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md) and working properly. Add `austinb/gameq` as a requirement to composer.json by using `composer require austinb/gameq:3.*@stable` or by manually adding the following to the *composer.json* file in the **require** section:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n\"austinb/gameq\": \"3.*@stable\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nUpdate your packages with `composer update` or install with `composer install`.\r\n\r\n#### Standalone Library\r\nDownload the [latest version](https://github.com/Austinb/GameQ/releases) of the library and unpack it into your project.  Add the following to your bootstrap file:\r\n```php\r\nrequire_once('/path/to/src/GameQ/Autoloader.php');\r\n```\r\nThe Autoloader.php file provides the same auto loading functionality as the Composer install. \r\n\r\n### Example\r\n```php\r\n$GameQ = new \\GameQ\\GameQ();\r\n$GameQ->addServer([\r\n    'type' => 'css',\r\n    'host' => '127.0.0.1:27015',\r\n]);\r\n$results = $GameQ->process();\r\n```\r\nNeed more?
